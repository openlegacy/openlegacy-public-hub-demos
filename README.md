# OpenLegacy Public Hub Demos

## Welcome to OpenLegacy's Public Hub Demos
The step by step guides in this repository will let you work with OpenLegacy's Hub. They will walk you through creating modules and projects, generating and running low-code and no-code solutions and testing your APIs.

Each unit demonstrates a business scenario implementing a different technology or connecting to a different backend. Some units may demonstrate a deployment scenario

Each guide contains the steps and assets needed to complete the demo.

Even though you will be working in a sandbox environment, with synthetic data, there are still some pre-requirements that must be met before you can start the demos.
